## My process
I was honestly feeling a bit stuck and bored — I wanted to do something practical instead of just going through theory or syntax notes. That’s when I came across Frontend Mentor, a site full of real-world UI challenges designed to help developers learn by building.

The QR code component was the first challenge I picked because it looked simple but clean — and that’s exactly what I needed to get started.

I started coding it with just HTML and CSS, and even though it seemed easy at first, I had to figure out:

-How to properly center elements using Flexbox

-How to use media queries to make it responsive

-How to structure the layout and spacing without things looking cluttered

It wasn’t perfect on the first try, and I did get a little stuck on styling (and that huge QR image ), but slowly I got the hang of it

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
- Confidence, the most important thing and to apply the knowledge I learned from tutorial
- revision of topics like flex box and media query
- practical application of media query
